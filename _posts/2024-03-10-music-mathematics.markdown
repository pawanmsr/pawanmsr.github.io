*The music we learn is practical. I have been mapping the practical aspects (such as octaves and scales) to mathematical concepts (such as fourier transformation, reverberation, interference and resonance, overtones, superposition and beats, timbre and many more). It has been fun but nothing close to writing a monograph or creating tools and visualizations. Enjoy the poem below, till I make significant strides worth publishing.*

My poems are result of my reveries.  

## Application

I intend to present a simple application along with the monograph. If you are into programming then you can check it out [here](https://github.com/pawanmsr/staver){:target="_blank"}.
