## A Dose of Motivation

## Keep Going  

*This poem was a consequence of news articles, opinions and comments while I was trying to evaluate and adapt to current social and professional trends, so that I would not be left too far behind, and figure out all the things I could do, while eliminating those that I could never be exceptional at.*

*Back to engineering, I experimented with path and graph traversals by applying them on a cross-platform application, which I called [Husband(c)ry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dWO48w6JSjfZhGTcCgc64NsyU-y8N965/view) (for hilarity). A more tactile solution to similar problem would require programming a finite state machine and loading it on a micro-controller.*

## Perspective

*I use this poem as a lesson on the difficulty of switching context.*

Inspired, impersonal but original.  
My poems are result of my reveries.  
I couldn't think of a better titles - naming can be difficult.
