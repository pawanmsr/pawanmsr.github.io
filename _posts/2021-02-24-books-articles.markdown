### The Engineering Booklist  

Suggested popular reads about non-technical aspects of the fields. *Every field has books written by notable and distinguished individuals. I mention only those that I found and read (partly or whole).*

Biographies and books by organizations are also a great way to gain perspective. Individuals who learn better by visual means may recourse to documentaries and interviews. Sometimes the views and opinions may be lopsided, and so it becomes essential to be mindful that one might not get to do everything they aspire to - there are people and processes involved, which naturally leads to a constant tussle from tug of war between conflicting interests.
