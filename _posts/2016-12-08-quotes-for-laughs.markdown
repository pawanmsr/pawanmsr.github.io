*I thought of using on my poems to test out my (old) blog, but when I skimmed through my journal, I realized that most of what I wrote (at that time) was not worth reading if not completely garbage, but the quotes I had been collecting seemed pretty interesting. So I listed some of the funniest ones, and since then I haven't felt like removing this post.*

Found these in my Journal. Chuckle off!

Albert Einstein:
> Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age of eighteen.

Robert Benchley:
> Drawing upon my fine command of the English language, I said nothing.

Mark Twain:
> Get your facts first, then you can distort them as you please.

Abraham Lincoln:
> No man has good enough memory to be a successful liar.

Jim Carey:
> Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.

Eddie Cantor:
> It takes years to become an overnight success.

Mae West:
> Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before.

Elbert Hubbard:
> Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.

Isaac Asimov:
> People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.

Theodore Roosevelt:
> If you could kick the person in the pants responsible for most of your trouble, you would not sit for a month.

Murray Gell-Mann:
> Think how hard physics would be if particles could think.

Albert Einstein:
> Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.  

*Ofcourse there are many funny things people would (or would not have said but were wrongly attributed) - these are just the ones I had came across.*
