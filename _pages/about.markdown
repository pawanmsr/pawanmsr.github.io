title: About
---

This is **not** exactly a portfolio website. This site acts as one of my happy places where I express some of my thoughts, and share my learnings, projects, books, hobbies and more. I usually write for people like me or younger.

*I harbour slight social anxiety, which coupled with impassiveness gives people an impression of naivety. If anything seems even slightly offensive or puerile, then please consider it an attempt at humour.*

## Theme

I built this site to enable me to share more of my math-heavy articles, while enabling me to further customize for other different types of blog posts, which wasn't quite possible through [Daktilo](https://daktilo.github.io/){:target="_blank"} (that I was using before). If you like it feel free to [download](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-bhautiki){:target="_blank"} and customize.
